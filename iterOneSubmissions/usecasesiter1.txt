Iteration1

Use Cases

clicked on the create box button; Box was created to the right which was intended

clicked on the create box button again; Box was created on top of the 1st box, in the
next iterations it would be more user-friendly to distinguish between the two, maybe have
a box created based off a mouse listener instead

clicked on the box; the box was recognized as being selected and the two buttons delete box
and add relation showed up like they were supposed to

clicked on delete the box after box was selected; the box was removed from the scene

pressed on and dragged/attempted to move the box; the box moved and as it was moving the grid
showed up behind the box which was good.  The box was clearly snapping to the grid as it was 
being moved and when movement finished as well.  The cursor though seemingly went to the top left
of the box when the box was being moved.  This is a minor nuisance to the user and could use a 
minor fix.  

created two boxes and after having selected one, clicked add relation then clicked the other box;
the line was drawn from the center of box1 to the center of box2 like planned.  This will be 
changed to somewhere along the perimeter in future iterations.
